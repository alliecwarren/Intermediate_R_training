# Intermediate_R_training
Notebooks for real world examples of topics from the Intermediate R training course

These notebooks correspond to various R courses from DataCamp, although they can also be used indepdently by any public health individual looking to learn R. The goal of the notebooks is to show example of the concepts of each course on real world public health data. The notebooks also show related concepts that might not be covered in the course, but which I think are useful. All data needed to run these notebooks are provided in the data folder.

The 5 notebooks (found in the notebooks folder) are:
- programming_with_dplyr, which corresponds to the course 'Programming with dplyr'. This notebook uses ACS data to show examples of joining data, selecting aspects of the data, tidy evaluation, filtering data, mutating data, string transformations, and visualizing data
- Intermediare_R, which corresponds to the course 'Intermediate R'. This notebook uses Household Pulse Survey Data and covers topics such as conditional logic, apply statements, formatting dates, loops, cleaning strings, calculating summary stats, and more.
- dealing_with_missing_data, which corresponds to the course 'Dealing with Missing Data in R'. This notebook uses data on chronic conditions in WA Medicare Beneficiaries and covers how to summarize, visualize, and replace missing data.
- introduction_to_data_visualization, which corresponds to the course 'Introduction to Data Visualizating with ggplot2'. It uses data on respiratory hospitalizations in WA to show how to create scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, lollipop plots, density plots, box plots, violin plots, and WA State map plots, as well as how to label plots, handle overplotting, and use different themes.
- introduction_to_statistics_in_R, which corresponds to the course 'Introduction to Statistics in R'. It uses various survey data to cover topics such as examining the distribution of your data, calculating summary statistics, calculating correlations between different types of variables, testing for normality, and t-tests.
